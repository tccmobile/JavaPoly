# JavaPoly


This Java program demonstrates the concepts:

1. Inheritance: Both `Circle` and `Rectangle` inherit from the `Shape` class.

2. Abstract Base Class: `Shape` is an abstract base class with an abstract method `getArea()`.

3. Runtime Type Identification (RTTI): In the `main` method, using `instanceof` to check the runtime type of each shape.
